Single-File Torrent Downloader (Leech-Only)

This is a minimalistic approach on building a torrent client which supports a single file download and supports only HTTPS trackers. I have currently only implemented the download feature
and there is no uploading of torrent files supported. This is a feature planned to be implemented along with directory based file download support.
